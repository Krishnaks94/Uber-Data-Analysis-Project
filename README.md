# Uber Data Analyst Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data to derive meaningful insights for improving operational efficiency, identifying patterns, and making data-driven decisions. The dataset includes information on Uber trips, including start and end times, categories, locations, miles traveled, and purposes of the trips. The goal of this analysis is to provide an understanding of Uber's ride patterns, identify trends, and visualize key metrics.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis is a CSV file named UberDataset.csv, containing the following columns:

START_DATE: The date and time when the trip started.

END_DATE: The date and time when the trip ended.

CATEGORY: The category of the trip (e.g., Business, Leisure).

START: The starting location of the trip.

STOP: The destination location of the trip.

MILES: The distance traveled in miles.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the trip (e.g., Meeting, Customer Visit, Meal/Entertain).

## Data Information
Total records: 1156 trips

Missing values: Some columns (e.g., PURPOSE) have missing values.

Data types: The dataset consists of numeric and categorical data types.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- The dataset is loaded using pandas and stored in the variable dataset.

- Missing values and data types are checked to ensure proper handling.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Basic statistics and data visualizations are created to understand the distribution of ride categories, miles, and trip purposes.

- Distribution of trips based on categories, miles, and purpose of trips is analyzed.

### 3. Data Cleaning
- The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values and correcting incorrect data formats.

- Time-related columns are converted to datetime objects for better analysis.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Various visualizations are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze:
  -  The number of trips based on categories.
  -  Miles traveled across different categories.
  -  The distribution of trips based on purpose.

## Results
- Insights from the analysis reveal key trends in Uber trip patterns, such as the most frequent trip categories, average miles traveled per trip, and common trip purposes.

- Visualizations help in understanding seasonal trends and operational areas where Uber's services could be optimized.
